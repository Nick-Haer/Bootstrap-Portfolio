# Bootstrap-Portfolio

This project showcases another stage of my web developmentjourney. Made using bootstrap, this site is resposive on mobile, and serves to provide information about me, my motivations, and my projects. Find the deployed version here https://nick-haer.github.io/Bootstrap-Portfolio/

For this project, I hope to provide a mobile responsive site that talked about my story, and put the projects I have been working on display.

To do this, I learned how to use Bootstrap, focusing on its mobile-first model. For the display section, I looked into some HTML/CSS tricks to add links to pictures and center text on images. Brining it all together, the result is a readable and infromative site, that can help serve as an ambassador of the skill set I've learned.
